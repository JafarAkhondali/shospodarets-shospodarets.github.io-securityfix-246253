<blockquote>This HTML template has been created to to help you get started with your article right away. Please take a look at our "<a href="editorial-style-guide.html" target="_blank">Editorial Style Guide</a>" &mdash; you'll be sure to find some snippets that will help you out every now and then.</p>

<p>All you need to do now is open this file in an HTML editor (if you haven't done so already) and start writing! Please don't hesitate to contact the editors at Smashing Magazine if you happen to experience any trouble.</blockquote>

<br/>

<h2>Title Of Your Article</h2>

<p>Please write a brief introduction &mdash; not too long, but not too short. A minimum of 85 words would be optimal. This will also be used on the front page of the magazine.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The title and all headings should be appealing, concrete and descriptive.</li>
	<li>Your article should be original and valuable. If possible, avoid iterating on arguments and ideas that have been endlessly discussed on the web.</li>
	<li>Be concise, and don’t exaggerate. For example, “absolutely awesome!” and “the coolest feature I’ve ever seen!” doesn’t quite fit Smashing Magazine’s objective style.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Heading <code>h3</code> </h3>

<p>Your article should bridge theory and practice. Our readers are quite advanced and seek professional advice. After reading the article, readers should not only have gained new insights and ideas, but also know how to actually implement these insights and ideas in practice.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Practical examples are quite important. Feel free to share your expertise with readers, including mistakes you’ve made, things you’ve learned throughout your career and things you wish you had known earlier. The more practical your tips, techniques and ideas are, the better.</li>
	<li>Please make sure your article is useful and comprehensive. Ask yourself whether you have addressed the most obvious issues that our readers might wonder about? Can you anticipate any specific questions that might be asked and probably should be discussed in the article?</li>	
	<li>The more thought-provoking your article, the better. Our readers appreciate articles that describe the various workflows of designers and developers all over the globe. When sharing your opinions or statements, please double check them and make sure to link to sources that support your claims. Our ultimate goal is to engage members of the design community in meaningful design discussions &mdash; not flaming.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Heading <code>h4</code></h4>

<p>The quality of images and screenshots is very important in our articles.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Please do not compress your images. Use programs such as ImageOptim, Photoshop, Fireworks, Gimp, IrfanView, etc. to keep images from losing quality and look super-blurry.</li>
	<li>Send images in the largest possible resolutions to the editor(s) at Smashing Magazine so that they can save the files locally and optimize them for the web.</li>
	<li>All inline images in the article should be in the highest possible resolution, and they should link to an even larger version.</li>
	<li>If the images do not belong to you, please kindly credit accordingly (not necessary for your own screenshots, of course).</li>
	<li>Please save all images in the <a href="article-images">images folder</a> which you'll find in the ZIP file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<figure>
	<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/take-a-vacation-for-real-large-preview.jpg"><img src="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/take-a-vacation-for-real-opt.jpg" alt="Description of the image." /></a><figcaption>A detailed caption that explains the image. (Image credit: <a href="http://unsplash.com/">Name of source</a>) (<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/take-a-vacation-for-real-large-preview.jpg">View large version</a>)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is what the code should look like for the images in your article:</p>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href="article-images/high-res/high-res.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="article-images/large-image.jpg" alt="Description of the image." /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A detailed caption that explains the image. (Image credit: &lt;a href="image-credit-URL">Name of source&lt;/a&gt;) (&lt;a href="article-images/high-res/high-res.jpg"&gt;View large version&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;	
</code></pre>

<p>Please avoid embedding text in images if possible; putting the text in the body of a paragraph or in an image caption is more appropriate.</p>


<h4>Final Notes</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Please provide links and references to related articles, tools, services, books and other resources at the end of your article.</li>
	<li>Please also try to avoid using footnotes and endnotes. They only make sense in printed books (where they keep the main content from getting cluttered), whereas web articles should really be using the web as it was intended (i.e. to link between pages).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Author's Biography</h3>

<p>Please provide a short description of yourself (in the third person) to add to your author's bio at the end of the article. Also, please note that your profile picture will be automatically generated via <a href="http://gravatar.com/">Gravatar.com</a>.</p>
