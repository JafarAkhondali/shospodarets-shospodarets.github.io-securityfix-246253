share_description: Platform engineering- From culture to practice
---

Iâ€™m delighted to be [a speaker](https://platformcon.com/speakers/serg-hospodarets)
at the upcoming PlatformCon conference and share my experience on Platform Engineering.

I want to share the experience from my journey of building great teams and delivering the Platforms to enable the business and customers.

The talk will guide you on how to proceed with the Teams and organization topology,
which [tooling](https://github.com/shospodarets/awesome-platform-engineering) and approaches will help you, and how to build the culture and deliver.

No talk is good without the demo, so expect the live demos ðŸ™‚

Feel free to join, and you can find more details at [https://platformcon.com/talks/platform-engineering-from-culture-to-practice](https://platformcon.com/talks/platform-engineering-from-culture-to-practice)
