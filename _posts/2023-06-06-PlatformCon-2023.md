share_description: PlatformCon 2023 Platform engineering- From culture to practice
---

I was delighted to be [a speaker](https://platformcon.com/speakers/serg-hospodarets)
at the upcoming PlatformCon conference and share my experience on Platform Engineering.

I shared the experience from my journey of building great teams and with them delivering the Platforms to enable the business and customers.

The talk guides you on how to proceed with the Teams and organization topology,
which [tooling](https://github.com/shospodarets/awesome-platform-engineering) and approaches will help you, and how to build the culture and deliver.

No talk is good without the demo, so expect the live demos ðŸ™‚
